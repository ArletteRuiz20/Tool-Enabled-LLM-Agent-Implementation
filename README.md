# Tool-Enabled-LLM-Agent-Implementation
(Google ADK + Gemini) -  This project demonstrates the implementation and execution of a tool-enabled AI agent using Google’s Agent Development Kit (ADK) and the Gemini language model.  The goal of this project was to understand how modern agent frameworks allow large language models to perform multi-step reasoning and interact with external tools.
